Instagram Challenge
===================

The challenge this weekend is to build an instagram clone using Ruby on Rails.
As an MVP, I want a user to be able to
  
  * log in using OAuth
  * post pictures and add a caption
  * see pictures posted by other users
  * comment on a picture
  * like a picture

If I have time, I would like to implement:

  * ability to see a user's profile
  * add search


Way of proceeding
-----------------

  1. Write out the user stories 

*Of course, in a real life situation I would write these out in dialogue with a client... so for the purpose of this challenge I will attempt the daring feat of begin both developer AND client.*
